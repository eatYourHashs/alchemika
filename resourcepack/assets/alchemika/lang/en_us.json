  "item.alch.note.intro": "Alchemical Foundations",
  "item.alch.note.intro.lore": "Unidentified Note 1 of 4",
  "item.alch.note.intro.1": "These writings will serve as the recordings of my experiments with the compositional forces of this world - the forces of alchemy, as they shall be dubbed. Until today, I was but a humble man, but now I call myself an Alchemist. These mysterious forces will be bent to my will, and I shall detail my methodology within these texts.",
  "item.alch.note.intro.2": "The most crucial tool of alchemy is the cauldron. It is the vessel that converges the elements, allowing a myriad of substances to be worked with safely. Basic cauldrons, forged from iron, have already seen use all over the world, so there should be no trouble procuring one.",
  "item.alch.note.intro.3": "The next implements of concern are the scoop and stirring rod. I will need to be able to safely remove solid material from my cauldron as needed, as well as stir my cauldron to facilitate alchemical transmutations. Iron should do the trick for the scoop, while wood shall be used for the stirring rod.",
  "item.alch.note.intro.4": "Once items have been put into the cauldron, I observe a wide variety of changes to take place depending on the cauldron’s environment. Certain substances may undergo changes when heated by a flame under the cauldron, and likewise when chilled by something intensely cold such as ice.",
  "item.alch.note.intro.5": "I observe some combinations of substances to undergo changes on their own after being left alone for a period of time, while others undergo changes when stirred via my stirring rod. Some substances, when a particular item is put into the cauldron, may create a new item or substance in response.",
  "item.alch.note.intro.6": "In the event my notes are scattered, it will be the natural course of things that brings them to their reader. I am sure of it. In the meantime, research shall continue. I must discover the secrets of this world, at any cost.",
  "item.alch.note.smelting": "Cauldron Applications: Smelting",
  "item.alch.note.smelting.lore": "Unidentified Note 2 of 4",
  "item.alch.note.smelting.1": "One obvious application of the cauldron appears to be in melting metal, much like a furnace would. The usage of the cauldron avoids hauling coal or similar flammables around, instead relying on a heat source like fire or lava under the cauldron. Shovel in raw ores, let them simmer, and come back to fresh molten metal.",
  "item.alch.note.smelting.2": "A slight complication arises in the use of this method: a molded cast is needed to form ingots so that the metals may be used for smithing. Conveniently, this can also be made in the cauldron using clay. Any metal ingot will work for this purpose.",
  "item.alch.note.sulfur_salt": "Alchemical Substances",
  "item.alch.note.sulfur_salt.lore": "Unidentified Note 3 of 4",
  "item.alch.note.sulfur_salt.1": "I have discovered two naturally-occuring substances that have notable alchemical properties: salt and sulfur. Salt is present in a dissolved form in ocean water, which makes it hard to gather; however, it tends to collect on the forms of both drowned and ocean guardians. It is both an important reagent and a tasty seasoning for various foods.",
  "item.alch.note.sulfur_salt.2": "Sulfur, a pungent, yellow powder, occurs in trace concentrations in lapis lazuli ore, as well as magma. Traditional excavation will sometimes reveal this dust, but supposedly, the arcana known as “enchantments” that has long been practiced in this world may be able to improve one’s yield.",
  "item.alch.note.sulfur_salt.3": "Another method of obtaining sulfur is via distillation of the explosive powder that powers creepers. Simply place the gunpowder in one’s cauldron and let it stagnate to separate it into charcoal and sulfur.\n",
  "item.alch.note.sulfur_salt.4": "The stirring rod may also be used to recombine gunpowder in this same manner.\n",
  "item.alch.note.cooking": "Cauldron Applications: Cooking",
  "item.alch.note.cooking.lore": "Unidentified Note 4 of 4",
  "item.alch.note.cooking.1": "This morning, I was starving when I woke up; the local villagers have been taking all the bread and carrots for themselves, leaving none for my breakfast. A proper alchemist would never allow himself to wither! It was necessary to get to work, and I have thus devised multiple simple food products that can be created in one’s cauldron.",
  "item.alch.note.cooking.2": "The simplest of these products is known as cheese. Simply allow cow’s milk to curdle in one’s cauldron and you will have a nutritious, pungent ooze - like a delicious spinoff of sulfur!\n",
  "item.alch.note.cooking.3": "If milk is combined with molten sugar, it will instead create caramel, a delicious refinement of sugar that might pair well with some fruits. Further research will commence on this matter.\n",
  "item.alch.note.cooking.4": "Mix together milk, sugar, and the cocoa beans grown in jungles, stir vigorously, and one may create chocolate, a delectable sweet treat that can be enjoyed in solid or bottled form.\n",
  "item.alch.note.cooking.5": "Lastly, what I actually ended up having for breakfast after all that concocting: bacon. Simply add salt to pork, and enjoy culinary perfection.\n\n",
  "item.alch.note.cooking.6": "Clearly, my current living situation alongside the villagers is not working out. I shall soon construct a new underground laboratory, away from those troublemaking rabblerousers. No one shall disrupt progress."
